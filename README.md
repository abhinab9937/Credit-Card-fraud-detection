💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection & Power BI Visualization
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a credit card fraud detection system using Machine Learning (Random Forest & Decision Trees), combined with Power BI dashboards for visualization.
Fraudulent transactions pose a major risk in the financial industry, and leveraging ML models provides a scalable and effective way to detect such anomalies in real time.

⚙️ How It Works
🔹 1. Data Preprocessing

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values.

Applied feature normalization for consistent scaling.

Addressed class imbalance (fraud vs. non-fraud transactions) using resampling techniques.

🔹 2. Model Training

Decision Tree Classifier: A simple yet interpretable model that partitions data based on feature conditions.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for higher accuracy and reduced overfitting.

🔹 3. Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using multiple performance metrics:

Accuracy – Overall correctness.

Precision – How many predicted frauds were actually fraud.

Recall – How many frauds were successfully detected.

F1-Score – Balance between precision and recall.

🔹 4. Visualization (Power BI)

Built interactive dashboards to analyze fraud trends.

Visualized transaction patterns, fraud distribution, and model performance metrics.

Provided actionable insights for decision-makers.

🔹 5. Deployment

The best-performing model can be integrated into real-world systems to flag fraudulent transactions in real-time.
